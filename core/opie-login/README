    QDM - the Login-Dialog for QPE


WHAT'S THIS:

This small add-on for the Qtopia Environment (QPE - see
http://qpe.sourceforge.net for further details) allows You to use your
handheld computer running QPE and Linux with the typical Un*x user
handling, i.e. just log in on a graphical environment, as e.g. KDM or
XDM. This way your personal data can be easily protected against
unwanted access from others in case you loose your machine.


STATUS:

Still in development, but should be useable.


REQUIREMENTS:

- QDM needs Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) for
  proper user validation.

- the /dev/fb0 device has to writeable to everyone ;-(


INSTALLATION:

Per default this little add-on is not enabled. You have to do so
yourself for now, by setting a compile option variable called
QT_QWS_LOGIN . Furthermore there have to be made some changes in
launcher/taskbar.pro :

At the section HEADERS insert a line:
		  ../login/qdmdialogimpl.h \

At the section SOURCES insert a line:
		  ../login/qdmdialogimpl.cpp \

furthermore serte these lines:	

INCLUDEPATH	+= ../login
DEPENDPATH	+= ../login

INTERFACES	= ../login/qdmdialog.ui

For unix-login make folloing changes to a line:
LIBS		= -lqpe -lcrypt

For PAM use the following:
LIBS		= -lqpe -ldl -lpam



CONFIGURATION:

Configuration of the 'Look' of QDM is done via Qt Designer. Just open
the .ui file and edit the look of the dialog as you like. You can, for
instance, change the logo pixmap. QDM should also be ready for i18n so
far.

Other configuration stuff, eg welcome string in the upper right, and
user list can be changed in the qdm_config.h file.


USAGE:

The QDM comes up, when the QPE is started, and if the QPE is started
as 'root'. Being started as any other user, the uid couldn't be
changed and the login dialog wouldn't be ofg much use.
