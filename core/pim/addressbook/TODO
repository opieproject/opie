Stuff todo until OPIE 1.0 :
===========================

Feature requests:
-----------------
- Dial by mobile phone by tapping the number.. 
  (Maybe using gsmtool. And we may
	add a library class for this)
- dial with dtmfdial in case it's installed and there's no mobile
- 3rd column for 2. Contact
- Implementing additional Views (Phonebook, ...)
- Birthday & Anniversary Reminder
- Beaming of multiple contacts (current list/ by search or by category)
- Configure the letter-picker: lastname/fullname search 
- User center of the joypad to switch back from card to listview !

  (behaviour should be selectable by configuration)

Known Bugs:
-----------

Bugs but not in addressbook:
-----------------------------
- VCARD: If umlaut (äöüß) in address, the parser gets confused..


Urgent:
--------
- Category is on the wrong position after changing to personal and back to normal
	( Temporarily workaround: Category is never deactivated.. :S )


Important:
----------

- "What's this" should be added (Deleyed after Feature Freeze)

Less important:
---------------
- Reload if contacts were changed externally
- The picker (alphabetical sort widget) should be
   placed verticaly or horizontally (configurable)
- Find a smart solution for activating/deactivating the "send email" event
- If new contact is added (contacteditor closed): focus (table, card) to
  this entry !
- After search (Started with Return): KeyFocus should be on Tabelle

ContactEditor:
- Redesign of Contacteditor
