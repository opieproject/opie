Stuff todo until OPIE 1.0 :

Feature requests:

- Dial by mobile phone by tapping the number.. 
  (Maybe using gsmtool. And we may
	add a library class for this)
- 3rd column for 2. Contact

Known Bugs:
- Personal Details not working
- Contact-Editor is temporarely reanabled. Wait for replacement.
- If category changed, the letterpicker should be resetted
- Return from Contacteditor: Category resettet to all
- OK-Key does not switch from Detailview to Listview

Urgent:

Important:

- Add "Do you really want to close app" Box.
- Redesign of Contacteditor
- Store last settings of combo-boxes

- Name order selected in "contacteditor" not used in list view.
- Overview window cleanup needed..
- Reload if contacts were changed externally
- "What's this" should be added (Deleyed after Feature Freeze)

Less important:

-  The picker (alphabetical sort widget) should be
   placed verticaly or horizontally (configurable)
- Finishing of new View functions (List, Phonebook...)

Should be Fixed (not absolute sure, need further validation):


Fixed:
- Syncing: abtable not reloaded after sync.
- Find widget should be replaced by something like 
  qpdf has.
- Adding a configuration dialog
- Picker: Activated letter schould be more visible
- Advanced handling of cursor keys (search..)
- Mail-Icon is missing
- Use opie-mail insted of qt-mail if possible.
- Font menu is invisible using german translation
- Personal contact editor: Disable categories
- "Nonenglish" translation bug has to be fixed.
- contacteditor: Birthday, annyversary, ... : Use Dateselector
- The names of the countries are sorted by there english names, only..
  Even if they are translated.. :S
- Cursor keys should work in detail-view (ablabel)
  -> Ablabel should be removed and Abtable should be increased with
	different views (as started by darwin zins)..
- Use advanced database functions in abtable to decrease
  memory footprint and to make everything more easy !
	(abtable should store Iterator for selected Category)
- Abtable: Configure Contact column (internally already available, 
	need configuration)
- Select of primary contact (see #274 on mantis)
- Category-select does not work completely: "Unfiled" is always in listview ..
