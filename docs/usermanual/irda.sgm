<chapter id=irda><title>IrDA Applet</title>
<para>
The IrDA Applet provides a GUI for easilly controlling communication between your device and others using the IrDA 
protocol.  You can use it to communicate with PalmOS based devices, cell phones, and almost anything else that
can use infra red to communicate.

<section><title>Starting IrDA</title>
<para>
To start IrDA, click the IrDA Applet icon in the taskbar, and select "Enable IrDA".  The icon should then turn red, and 
clicking the icon should then bring up a larger menu.  If this does not happen, you do not have the IrDA modules installed 
properly on you device.  Make sure you install the IrDA driver package for the device and distribution that you are using.

<section><title>Recieving Files</title>
<para>
If you want to recieve files like images or contact information from another device, you need to tell your device to 
start looking for other devices.  Do this by clicking on the IrDA Applet icon and selectiong "Enable Discovery".  A 
green dot should appear in the upper right hand corner of the IrDA Applet icon.  Then select "Enable Recieve" from 
the applet's menu, and a white box should appear in the bottom left corner of the IrDA Applet's icon.  You can then 
have the other device send the file, and &opie; should recieve it and open the file in whatever application is 
appropriate.
</para>
<para>
When you are done recieving files, you will want to select "Disable Recieve" and "Disable Discovery" from the 
IrDA Applet's menu so that you are not wasting system resources.

<section><title>Beaming Files</title>
<para>
Several applications support beaming files in a format specific to that application (specifically, Contacts, Calendar, 
and Todo).  However, sometimes you may need to simply send a file to another device via IrDA, regardless of the 
file type.  To do this, you can use either AdvancedFM (yet to be documented), or you can do this from the 
Documents tab.  To beam a file from the Documents tab, you must first add that file to the Documents tab if you 
havent already (see <xref linkend="adddoc">).  Then, go to the Documents tab and press and hold on the icon for 
the file you want to send.  A dialog should appear, with a button in the bottom right labeled "Beam".  Press this 
button, and &opie; will beam the file to any waiting devices.
</para>

<section><title>Stoping IrDA</title>
<para>
Sometimes it is necessary to stop IrDA, usually so that you can use the IR port for another application.  To do this, 
select "Disable IrDA" from the IrDA applet's menu.
