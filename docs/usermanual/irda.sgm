To start IrDA, click the IrDA Applet icon in the taskbar, and select "Enable IrDA".  The icon should then turn red, and 
clicking the icon should then bring up a larger menu.  If this does not happen, you do not have the IrDA modules installed 
properly on you device.  Make sure you install the IrDA driver package for the device and distribution that you are using.

If you want to recieve files like images or contact information from another device, you need to tell your device to 
start looking for other devices.  Do this by clicking on the IrDA Applet icon and selectiong "Enable Discovery".  A 
green dot should appear in the upper right hand corner of the IrDA Applet icon.  Then select "Enable Recieve" from 
the applet's menu, and a white box should appear in the bottom left corner of the IrDA Applet's icon.  You can then 
have the other device send the file, and Opie should recieve it and open the file in whatever application is 
appropriate.

When you are done recieving files, you will want to select "Disable Recieve" and "Disable Discovery" from the
