<section><title>iPAQ</title>
<para>
To install opie on an iPAQ, you will need a fresh Familiar installation (ie,
install Familiar, and stop before you do ipkg install task-complete or ipkg
install task-x), go to http://familiar.handhelds.org to get the latest version,
and to get installation instructions (again, stop after the initial boot and do
not install X, as it is not necessary, and will only take up space).
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you had qpe/qtopia installed previously,
<emphasis>completely</emphasis> remove it, and remove the src line for it from
your /etc/ipkg.conf file before attempting to install opie.
</para>
</note>
<para>
Once you have Familiar installed, set up a network connection between your iPAQ
and the ouside world (again, see the Familiar site for instructions on this),
and then run this command:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     echo src opie "http://131.152.105.154/feeds/ipaq/unstable/" \
          >> /etc/ipkg.conf
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
then, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg update && ipkg install task-opie
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
If you have a 3100 or 3800 series iPAQ, run:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     ipkg install qt-embedded-rotation
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
finally, start &opie; with:
<informalexample>
<literallayout>
     /etc/init.d/opie start
</literallayout>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
&opie; should now be running (if you should have to reboot, which is rare, &opie;
will start automatically). From here, you can use either the "Software"
application in the Settings tab, or run ipkg from the command line to install
other &opie; apps. Check out the various task-opie-* ipkgs to install various sets
of apps at once (you can always uninstall individual apps individually). You
will probably want to install opie-embeddedkonsole first, so you have access to
the command line in &opie;.

<section><title>Zaurus</title>
<para>
To completely install &opie; on the Zaurus, you will have to install OpenZaurus,
which includes &opie;. However, individual &opie; applications will work fine on the
default Zaurus rom. Do not install &opie;'s launcher on a default Zaurus ROM
though.
