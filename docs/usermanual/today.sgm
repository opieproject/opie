The &todayapp; application is a convenient way to view both the appointments from the Calendar and the tasks from the
Todo application for the current day, as well as seeing what e-mail is available.  It provides no interface for editing your
appointments, or your tasks, but if you click the icon of the application, it will be launched.  For those familiar with
PocketPC, this is similar to the &todayapp; application included with that.

The first field allows you to select the number of appointments to be shown in the Calendar section of the application.  
If you add more appointments, you will be taking away screen space from the other sections.
The "Should location be shown?" is for determining exactly that.  If checked, the location field of the appointment 
will be shown in the &todayapp; main view.
"Show only later appoinmtnets" will only show appointments that begin after the current time.
Finally, if the "Should the notes be shown" checkbox is checked, then the notes for each appointment will be visible 
in the main view.

The "Clip after how many letters" field lets you change the number of characters from each appointment or task that 
are displayed in the main view.  The "Should today be autostarted on resume" checkbox lets you set whether or not 
the &todayapp; application should be started each time you resume from a suspend or not.<note><para>This only works 
if you have a full installation of &opie;.  If you are running &todayapp; on some other environment (Qtopia, for example) 
this feature will not work.</para></note>The final field, "Activate autostart after how many minutes", lets you set 
the number of minutes that the device must be suspended before the &todayapp; application will start automatically on 
resume.  For instance, if this is set to 5, and you suspend the device for 3 minutes, when you resume the device, the 
&todayapp; application will not start automatically.  However, if it is set to 5 and you leave the device in the suspend state 
for 6 minutes, then &todayapp; will be started automatically upon resume.
