Information about porting Opie to MacOS-X (eilers)
==================================================

Credits:
--------

Special thanks to Andreas Junghans (webmaster@lucid-cake.net) for its patches for qt-X11 (2.3.2), 
QT/E (2.3.5) and qtopia (1.6.1).
Without them, I wouldn't be able to provide the port for OPIE to MacOS-X that fast..

Status:
-------
The basic system works quite well. But a lot of applications and plugins,
which are platform specific, need some work to be compileable.

What is ready:

libqpe
libopie1
pim-applications (addressbook, todolist, datebook, today)
A lot of applications and plugins which are not platform specific.

What will follow soon:

libopie2

Remember: A lot of configuration-settings are not tested (as for instance 
the quicklauncher) and might fail to compile. 
If you want to avoid misconfigurations, you may want to start with
the config-file in this directory. Just copy "config_macosx" to $OPIEDIR/.config
to get a working configuration to start with.

(The missing apps/plugins will be ported on demand.)

How to compile Opie for MacOS-X:
-------------------------------

Before compiling for MacOS-X, you need the following:

1. X11-Server (Provided by Apple)
2. QT-2.3.2 for X11
3. QT/E-2.3.7
4. Patches for QT-2.3.2 for MacOSX
5. Patches for QT/E-2.3.7 for MacOSX

Please follow the instructions by http://www.lucid-cake.net/osx_qpe/index_de.html
how to create a buildsystem for your Mac.
What is different to the previous desciption: 
You don't need Qtopia ! 
It is recommended to use QT/E in version 2.3.7 instead of 2.3.5 as described.
The Patch for QT/E for Opie, including all other opie-patches is available in the
qt-directory ($OPIEDIR/qt) and is called "qte237-all-macosx.patch".

If your buildsystem is working correctly, you should be able to build
opie. You have to enter "make menuconfig" and set 
"Build Parameters"->"Target Machine"->"Mac OS X (DARWIN)"
activate the platform specific changes.

You will see that a lot of applications and plugins/applets will not compile
successfully, due to the fact that they are not ported to this platform.
You may disable them to be able to compile the rest.


Information for Developers:
---------------------------

1. Platform specific code should be surrounded by
#ifdef Q_OS_MACX
MACOS-X CODE
#else
OTHER-CODE
#endif

2. The Plugin-Handling by MacOS-X is different than it is by Linux. 
On linux-systems, shared libraries are not different to dynamic loaded libraries
(aka plugins). They just are different whether they are loaded automatically
at startup or manually by any application.
On MacOS-X, the plugins are loaded by a special mechanism and must be in a special
binary format. Therefore you have to add the term "plugin" to the CONFIG-clause, as 
for instance:

TEMPLATE=lib
CONFIG += qt plugin release

If you don't add "plugin" you will get a shared library which is not loadable 
(Error-Code: NSObjectFileImageInappropriateFile (2))!
