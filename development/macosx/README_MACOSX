Information about porting Opie to MacOS-X (eilers)
==================================================

Credits:
--------

Special thanks to Andreas Junghans (webmaster@lucid-cake.net) for its patches for qt-X11 (2.3.2), 
QT/E (2.3.5) and qtopia (1.6.1).
Without them, I wouldn't be able to provide the port for OPIE to MacOS-X that fast..
Thanks to Juergen Graf to debug this very generic README ! 

Status:
-------
The basic system works quite well. But a lot of applications and plugins,
which are platform specific, need some work to be compileable.

What is ready:

libqpe
libopie1
libopie2/opiedb
pim-applications (addressbook, todolist, datebook, today)
A lot of applications and plugins which are not platform specific.

What will follow soon:

libopie2 


How to compile Opie for MacOS-X:
-------------------------------

Before compiling for MacOS-X, you need the following:

1. X11-Server+X11SDK 			(Provided by Apple)
2. QT-2.3.2 for X11 			(Provided by Trolltech)
3. QT/E-2.3.7       			(Provided by Trolltech)
4. Patches for QT-2.3.2 for MacOSX   	(take the one in this directory !)
5. Patches for QT/E-2.3.7 for MacOSX 	(take the one, provided in $OPIEDIR/qt)

The Patch for QT-2.3.2 is provided in this directory and is called "qt232-X11.patch".

The Patch for QT/E for Opie, including all other opie-patches is available in the
qt-directory ($OPIEDIR/qt) and is called "qte237-all-macosx.patch".

Please read further, how to compile the stuff.

HOWTO COMPILE:
-------------

Compile QT-2.3.2:

Go to into the basic directory of qt-2.3.2 and enter 
export QTDIR=`pwd`
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib
./configure -no-xft -platform darwin-g++
make
After compiling successful (I hope) you need qvfb:
cd tools/qvfb
make

Compile QT/E-2.3.7:

Got to into the basic directory of qt-2.3.2 and enter 
export QTDIR=`pwd`
export QPEDIR=$QTDIR
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib
./configure -platform darwin-generic-g++ -qconfig qpe -qvfb -depths 4,8,16,32
make

Now create a link for the uic of qt-2.3.2 into the bin-directory of qt/e 2.3.7 ! 
Otherwise OPIE will fail to compile !

Compile OPIE:
Set your environment
(You may use the script "set_vars.sh" to set your variables successfully !
BUT: You have to customize this script for YOUR needs !!)
Go into the basic directory of Opie
make menuconfig" 
set "Build Parameters"->"Target Machine"->"Mac OS X (DARWIN)" to activate the platform specific changes.
save and exit the menuconfig app
make

You will see that a lot of applications and plugins/applets will not compile
successfully, due to the fact that they are not ported to this platform.
You may disable them to be able to compile the rest.

Remember: A lot of configuration-settings are not tested and might fail to compile. 
If you want to avoid misconfigurations, you may want to start with
the config-file in this directory. Just copy "config_macosx" to $OPIEDIR/.config
to get a working configuration to start with.

(The missing apps/plugins will be ported on demand.)


SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR USERS OF PANTHER
----------------------------------------
I had a lot of problems compiling qt-2.3.2 and QT/E-2.3.7 on Panther. The
new release of the X-Server causes a lot of trouble.. 

To compile QT-2.3.2 successfully, you have to disable support of freetype fonts and you have
to use the patch in this directory, otherwise your wont't be able to compile !
Use the param "-no-xft" for the configure script to disable this function !

Information for Developers:
---------------------------

1. Platform specific code should be surrounded by
#ifdef Q_OS_MACX
MACOS-X CODE
#else
OTHER-CODE
#endif

2. The Plugin-Handling by MacOS-X is different than it is by Linux. 
On linux-systems, shared libraries are not different to dynamic loaded libraries
(aka plugins). They just are different whether they are loaded automatically
at startup or manually by any application.
On MacOS-X, the plugins are loaded by a special mechanism and must be in a special
binary format. Therefore you have to add the term "plugin" to the CONFIG-clause, as 
for instance:

TEMPLATE=lib
CONFIG += qt plugin release

If you don't add "plugin" you will get a shared library which is not loadable 
(Error-Code: NSObjectFileImageInappropriateFile (2))!
