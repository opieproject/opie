<p><b>Category Details</b>
<p> Categories are useful when you have large numbers of items, since you can just view those items that belong to a particular category.</p>
<p>By default all items are shown, regardless of category.</p>
<p>All applications use the same <a href="help/category-editing.html">Edit Categories Dialog</a> to create categories and to associate categories with items.</p>
