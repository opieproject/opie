<p><b>Keyboard</b>
<p> Pop up the input area in keyboard mode. (See <a href="help/help-input.html">Input Methods</a>.)</p>
<p>The keyboard works just like a full-size keyboard, except that you tap the keys instead of typing them. As you tap, words appear above the keyboard that you can tap to insert.</p>
<p>The Shift keys are 'sticky'; if you tap Shift, it will remain down until you tap it again or tap a letter.</p>
