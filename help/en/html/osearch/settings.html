<h2>Settings Menu</h2>
<h3>Search</h3>
<b>Case sensitiv</b><br>
Should the searches be case sensitiv.
<b>Use wildcards</b><br>
From the QT docu:<br>
... makes it convenient to match filenames instead of plain text. 
<br>
For example, "qr*.cpp" matches the string "qregexp.cpp" in wildcard mode, but not "qicpp" (which would be matched in normal mode).
