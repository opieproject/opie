<h1>Opie Console: Getting started</h1>

<p>Opie Console is Profile orientated. A "Profile" contains the
informations neccessary to connect to a remote host. For example
it includes which ConnectionType, Terminal, Font, Color and more
to be used.<br>

To set up a connection you can either use a previous saved profile 
or choose to create a connection on the fly.<br>

Go to "Connection" and "New Connection" for creating a connection or click
the "New" Button (<img src="new.png" width="14" height="14">) or
choose "New from Profile" and use a previously saved Profile.<br>

<p>After you clicked OK on the Connection Dialog you will see a new tab
was created. Depending of your preference either you're already connected
or you need to connect.<br>
<p>To connect click on the "Connection" menu and then on "connect". If you want to
disconnect you need to click "disconnect".<br>

<p>When you're done select "Close Window" from the "Connection" this will also
close the the connection and remove the widget from the main application view.<br>
<p>If an application in the terminal hangs you may choose to terminate that Connection<br>

<p>Text which gets selected inside the Terminal Widget will be transparently copied 
to the clipboard. You do not need to add it your self via a copy button.
