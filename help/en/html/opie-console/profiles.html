    <h1>Profile Editing</h1>
    <p>There are two ways to create a Connection by either using 'New Connection'
       ( <img src="new.png"> ) or to use a previously saved profile.
      Both ways involve the usage of the Profile Dialog.<br>
      <p>The dialog is divided into four tabs Profile, Connection, Terminal and
      Special.<br>
      <P><B>Profile</b> - In profile you need to set a Profile name below
      the equally named label. <br>
      <P><B>Connection</b>  - Then you need to choose a Connection type. 
      In this version Opie Console supports a legacy console called 
      'local console', a Serial and a Modem connection mode.
      Depending on this choice the second tab will have a different GUI.
      <a href="#con">More below.</a><br>
      <P><B>Terminal</b> - Here you may select a terminal emulation
      widget.<br>
      <P>The last item on this page is a option to automatically
	connect on creation.<br>
      <br><br>
      <a name="con"></a><p> The Connection Tab depends on the Connection
      Type used.<br>
      For local console there is no option available.<br>
      Modem and Serial share most of the configuration. You can select
      a device to use, the speed, the flow control and the parity. On top
      of that Modem let's you choose a number to dial and  to configure
      a set of AT commands.<br>
      <br><br>
      <p>The Terminal Tab let's you choose a Terminal Type, a color scheme,
      the font.<br>
      <br><br>
      <p>The fourth tab is there to configure the additional software keys for 
      a connection.<br>
      <br><br>

      <P>Clicking the OK button on the top right position accepts this dialog
      and the profile will be used.

      
      <h2>Using the Profile Editor</h2>
      <p>The Configuration Dialog can be accessed by either clicking
      on the 'Connection' Menu and then 'Configure Profiles' or by the
      item in the <a href="menubar.html">menu bar</a>.<br>
      <p>The list view contains the already saved profiles. You can add
      , remove and modify profiles by selecting one and clicking the
      appropriate button.<br>
