From a UNIX point of view we want to do something like minicom
with a better GUI.
It should feature some terminal emulation vt100/102, ansi,
filetransfer via {x,y,z}modem, and some sort of session management.
Besides this requirement we would like to be able to execute 'scripts'
in a session.
A script would just write to the TEmulation and then be sent via
an IOlayer.
Then we would like to send keys? Do we want that?
> what kind of keys would we send?

We want a modular architecture which might support plugins in
the future

(Almost) DONE:
  Framework
  Serial IOLayer
  Saving and Restoring Profiles
  ConfigDialog Framework
  IOLayer
  Profile->Session and MainWidget
  FilesendingLayer ( Z/Y Modem tested X does not work at all )

TASKS in progress:
  Irda  ConfigWidget - Harlekin
  BT ConfigWidget - Harlekin
  IRDA-Layer - Harlekin
  Bluetooth-Layer - Harlekin
  Modem - Harlekin
  Keys - hash
  TE - ibotty
  Scripting - wazlaf 
   
  Session->Profile - hash => why is this needed? you can not change any settings
                             after you start the session, so all you would do is
                             create a duplicate of the profile used to open the
                             current session. maybe needed later when you can change
                             settings while the session is running (colors, fonts...)
	             zecke => think of that. You try to hook up with a New Device 
		    	     neither know anything.... speed flow and such stuff
			     you start to experiment and it starts to work
			     now you want to save the session

OPEN tasks:
  Modem
  Fullscreen mode ( maybe spy at vnc viewer  or read NeoTrons HOWTO)
  Receiving ( copy &n paste from filetransfer.cpp )
