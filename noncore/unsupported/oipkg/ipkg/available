Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) on laptops
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation.  The apmd program also lets you run arbitrary programs
 when APM events happen (for example, you can eject PCMCIA devices when
 you suspend, or change hard drive timeouts when you connect the battery).
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon for logging and acting on APM
 events, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an X11 utility
 that displays a little graph, on_ac_power(1), a program for shell scripts
 to determine if wall power is connected, and tailf(1) which follows the
 growth of a log file without writing to disk.
 .
 The Debian default kernel does *not* contain APM support, because it causes
 problems on some computers.  So, you need to recompile your kernel
 and enable APM support during configuration; the corresponding questions
 are in the 'Character devices' section.

Description: NetBSD /bin/sh
 "ash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "ash", and is a required part of the system.

 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 It supports three kinds of file formats:
  * btree. A representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
  * hashed. An extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
  * UNIX file oriented. A byte stream file with fixed or variable
    length records.
 Other core database services:
  * page cache management for fast access, clean page allocation.
  * lock with multiple reader/writer granularity.
  * nested transaction support with logging and rollback recovery
    (two phase commit).
  * Large set of utility, to dump/load/restore data and examine log.

 The use of ntpdate is optional if you're running the ntp package, it can help
 a system obtain lock if it starts with a time that's pretty close by using
 ntpdate before starting the daemon.
 .
 The ntpdate client by itself is useful for occasionally setting the time on
 machines that are not on the net full-time, such as laptops.

Description: PCMCIA Card Services for Linux.
 NOTE: I couldn't find this package in Debian/arm so I just grabbed
 the control file from my Debian/i386 and combined it with the
 pcmcia-cs bits from familiar v0.4 bleeding. A better solution would
 be to rebuild the real .deb from the pcmcia-cs source.
 .
 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded
 capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs
 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in
 the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel version> is
 the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled.

Description: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) daemon.
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to transmit
 datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines
 at either end of the link (the "peers") to negotiate various optional
 characteristics of the link.  Using PPP, a serial link can be used to
 transmit Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams, allowing TCP/IP connections
 between the peers.

 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide rdist, and rsync with a secure communication channel.

 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In most
 cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or small
 screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 If you are not using a remote font server, you must install this package if
 you are installing an X server.  It contains fonts without which X servers
 will not work.
 .
 This package also provides a set of files that can be used by the X or
 fonts server to transcode fonts from one encoding to another (e.g., KOI8-R
 to ISO-8859-5).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories

Description: X Window System client libraries
 NOTE: I really want to break this package up into lots of little
 packages for familiar, (mainly so we can dump things like Xt if no
 binaries depend on them). - Carl Worth <cworth@handhelds.org>
 .
 The X libraries are an interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is
 independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries, and the programs that use them, communicate with X servers by
 means of the X protocol.
 .
 libX11 (a.k.a. Xlib) provides the low-level functionality, dealing mostly
 with the wire protocol and in terms of basic operations such as opening and
 closing the X protocol connection, creating graphics contexts, drawing
 graphics primitives such as lines, arcs, and glyphs, handling events, and so
 forth.
 .
 libXpm, the X pixmap library, is a set of routines used to store and retrieve
 X pixmaps (a data structure comprising a rectangular array of pixels) from
 files; the xpm file format is an extension of the monochrome bitmap file
 format in the X11 specification.  (Traditionally, libXpm was maintained and
 distributed separately from the X Window System, but XFree86 has absorbed
 this library).
 .
 libXt, the X Toolkit Instrinsics, is an abstract widget library upon which
 graphical widget libraries (such as Athena and LessTif) may be developed; the
 Intrinsics provide a number of useful interfaces to X conventions and
 protocols, in many cases reducing a long series of Xlib calls to just a
 couple of Xt calls.
 .
 libXmu is a set of miscellaneous utility functions useful to client
 programmers.
 .
 The remainder of the libraries in this package implement the client side
 of various X protocol extensions:
  - libICE, the Inter-Client Exchange extension;
  - libPEX5, PEX, a 3D graphics extension now superseded by Mesa/OpenGL;
  - libSM, the Session Management extension;
  - libXIE, the X Image Extension;
  - libXext, a collection of several commonly-used extensions;
  - libXi, the X Input extension;
  - libXp, the X Printing extension; and
  - libXtst, the X Testing extension.
 .
 xlibs also contains the XKB keyboard parameter files, locale data, and a set
 of bitmap and pixmap image files commonly used by X clients.
