LISAmail TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

General stuff:
 - If password is empty, ask for it during fetch.
 - Check if all necessary fields in AccoundEditor are filled. 

Protocol related:
 - The IMAP implentation is kinda strange and slow.
 - The SMTP implentation is goddamn strange.
 - POP3 support would be nice.
 - NNTP would be kinda neat, too.
 - Implent a plugin system.

Security related:
 - GnuPG support. This will require a seperate gpg managing utility in
   the settings tab.
 - sMIME? maybe in the distant future.

Mail management:
 - Header caching
 - Sieve filtering support?
 - Enqueueing/Draft support both on the IMAP server and local.

Testing:
 I'm using the courier-imap server at my developement site. I didn't have
 much opportunity to test on other servers. Giving me test-accounts on other
 servers would be helpfull.

If you want something added, drop a mail. Comments are allways welcome.
