udchcp needs to output the dhcp information so interfaces can read it

interfacesetupimp really doesn't need a interface* pointer

Possible other modules to write: ppp, ipsec, bluetooth, ipchains

PPP module needs to scan pppd.tdb to see what is currently active

WLAN - add possiblity to input text or hex without knowing "s:"

Interface setupimp needs to use kernel calls.

Automaticly update the main list of interfaces:

You can look up the meaning of the packets you receive, or you can just go 
poll for changes you might be interested in each time you receive _any_ 
packet. Anything's better than periodic polling.

Note that you can't do this as non-root on some kernels. There's a patch 
which can go into the hh.org kernel if it's not already there.
