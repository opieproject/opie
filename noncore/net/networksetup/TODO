test WEP
WEP key in file wireless.conf is not encrypted !, therefore it is very easy to get the key out of the zaurus..

udchcp needs to output the dhcp information so interfaces can read it

interfacesetupimp really doesn't need a interface* pointer

Possible other modules to write: ppp, ipsec, bluetooth, ipchains

PPP module needs to scan pppd.tdb to see what is currently active

WLAN - add possiblity to input text or hex without knowing "s:"

Interface setupimp needs to use kernel calls.
