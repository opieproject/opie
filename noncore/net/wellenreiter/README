Release Notes for Opie-ALPHA Version January 2002
--------------------------------------------------

=====================
= Supported Devices =
=====================

* low-level orinoco_cs-based (including prism2 and spectrum_cs)

=====================
=      Build        =
=====================

(I) Opie Build Environment

To compile Wellenreiter within the Opie build environment, add the
following directories to $OPIEDIR/Makefile, e.g. to 'NONAPPS='

noncore/net/wellenreiter/libwellenreiter \
noncore/net/wellenreiter/daemon \
noncore/net/wellenreiter/contrib/orinoco_hopper \
noncore/net/wellenreiter/gui

./configure and rebuild. Note that you need libpcap in your toolchain.

(II) OpenZaurus Build Environment

To compile Wellenreiter within the OZ build environment, add the
following lines to $OPIEDIR/packages:
CONFIG_WELLENREITER noncore/net/wellenreiter/libwellenreiter libwellenreiter.pro
CONFIG_WELLENREITER noncore/net/wellenreiter/daemon daemon.pro
CONFIG_WELLENREITER noncore/net/wellenreiter/gui gui.pro
CONFIG_WELLENREITER noncore/net/wellenreiter/contrib/orinoco_hopper orinoco_hopper.pro

make -f Makefile.test clean-configs
cd <BUILDROOT>
make SUBDIRS=packages/opie package

(III) To compile a standalone Wellenreiter for X11, you need Qt3 and the development
packages for Qt3, e.g. libqt3-devel. Assuming, $OPIEDIR and $QTDIR is set to Opie resp.
Qt (e.g. /usr/lib/qt3), do the following:
export QMAKESPEC=$OPIEDIR/mkspecs/linux-g++
cd $OPIEDIR/noncore/net/wellenreiter
qmake -makefile wellenreiter.pro
make qmake
make

=====================
=     Install       =
=====================

Alternatively, you can use our precompiled ipk. Get it from
http://opie.net.wox.org/wellenreiter/. This also includes a recent libpcap.

=====================
=       Run         =
=====================

There are two possible modes: <Manual> and <Automatic>. I suggest, you
start with the <Automatic> Mode. This works just using the "Start"
and "Stop" Pushbuttons in the Wellenreiter GUI. If this doesn't work,
then use the following strategy:

1. Place card in monitor mode. This is device dependent.

   Caution: Don't do this while you're logged in via ssh
   or otherwise using the wireless interface - your connection
   will freeze: The card can't be used normally when sniffing!

   For most orinoco-based cards this can be done using either
   'iwpriv <interface> 2' or 'iwpriv <interface> 2 1'.  
   
   You can check if this works, by calling 'ifconfig <interface>'.
   If you see 'Protocol: UNSPEC' and an unusual long MAC-Address,
   then your card has been successfully set to the monitor mode.

2. Start a channel hopper. A wireless card has several channels
   (e.g. radio frequencies) here it can listen for beacons.
   Beacons are management data frames from other stations.
   Remember, this is radio transmission, so the card has to be
   "tuned" to a certain channel to be able to receive the beacons.
   
   In order to scan the complete frequency spectrum and thus be able
   to detect all available stations, you have to 'hop' through the
   channels frequently. You can do this manually (e.g. with 'iwconfig')
   [hahaha] or you can use a channel hopper.  
   
   For convenience, the current Wellenreiter Alpha comes with a 
   channel hopper for Orinoco-based cards. Start this via 
   orinoco_hopper <interface>.

3. Start the Wellenreiter sniffing daemon: wellenreiterd.

4. Start the Wellenreiter GUI and sniff like hell. Don't press the button
   "Start Scan" yet, because it enables the demo mode and will crash the
   wellenreiterd daemon if running.
