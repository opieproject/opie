2004-??-??	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Switched to a (hopefully) more reliable method reading from gpsd.
	* Added parsing of named ProbeRequests. Display only-probed-yet SSIDs in a different network color.
	* Rewrote the simple actions on new {Network, Client, Station}. Besides playing a sound or
	  blinking a LED, a user customizable script can now be executed, if something has been
	  detected. This opens up many possibilities, i.e. a qcop to qpegps or exec'ing flite (speech).
	* Added decloaking of cloaked ESSIDs (length != 0, but essid[0] == \0).
	* Hided the 'Parse' Tab in the configuration window. Not functional now and may come later
	* Added parsing of control frames. Display stations sending them SSID "<unknown>" for now.
	* Added command line option "-nocheck" to skip non-root and dhcp tests.
	* Improved the speed reading the manufacturer list.
	* GPS coordinates are now presented in the DMS (as opposed to decimal) format.

2003-12-18	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Released as Version 1.0.2 (Development Snapshot)
	* Added automatic uploading of capture files to "The Capture Dump" site at
	  http://www.Vanille.de/projects/capturedump.spy
	* Initial reading of the manufacturer database happens now in background
	* Removed deprecated setMonitorMode() API ==> Use setMode( "monitor" ) now.
	  The monitor mode now tries to use the standard IW_MODE_MONITOR first. If that
	  doesn't work, it falls back to using the proprietary iwpriv commands

2003-11-30	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Released as Version 1.0.1 (Development Snapshot)
	* Fixed ARP decoding for wired networks.
	  Interestingly, 802.11 encapsulates these in IP packets, while wired ethernet just tags the type_of_protocol.
	* Added reading GPS data from a gps daemon.
	* Started preparations for utilizing Wellenreiter II in wired networks.
	* Implemented persistant configuration interface and retriggerable auto detection.
	* Added QCOP interface for talking to opie-networksettings.
	* Added parsing of DHCP packets and detecting DHCP servers.
	* Overhauled the configuration window and started with the customizable event system.
	* Added disabling the screensaver.
	* Added automatic opening and scrolling to the network tree if a new station appears.

2003-05-10	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Released as Version 1.0 (Stable)
	* Added restarting the dhcp client if having killed it before.
	* Decouple dump files from live capture to shift control over 'what' is dumped to applications.

2003-05-05	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Released as Version 1.0-RC1 (Release Candidate)
	* Fixed rare segfaults while sniffing and operating the GUI simultaenously.
	* Parse more data packets and detect more participating stations.
	* Added live graph window showing the signal strength on all channels.
	* Added parsing ARP packets and identifying IP addresses of participating stations.
	* Added parsing with optionally enabled PRISM headers (signal strength).

2003-04-12	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>
	
	* Released as Version 1.0 (Beta)
	* GUI enhancements in the Menubar and the Toolbar.
	* Improved keyboard handling.
	* Added sanity checks for running Wellenreiter II as non-root or with dhcp clients in the background.
	* Add writing and replaying of libpcap compatible capture files.

2003-04-08	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Released as Version 0.2 (Alpha)
	* Closed memory leak in packet capturer.
	* Fixed client stations appearing under essid as access points.
	* Fixed false WEP reporting in some cases.
	* Started with inspecting data packages.
	* Add detecting associated client stations in infrastructural networks (if they transmit data).
	* Worked around buggy hostap drivers writing past fixed-length-structures on arm.
	* Added dynamic checking of available private ioctls.
	* Added a saveable hex window for packet dissection.

2003-03-30	Michael Lauer 		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Released as Version 0.1 (Alpha)

2003-03-25	Michael Lauer		<mickey@Vanille.de>

	* Rewrote Wellenreiter II from scratch - including the sniffing engine.
	* Beacon inspection works and finds ad-hoc networks and managed networks.
