JPEGTOAVI
by Phillip Bruce


I. Introduction

In the tradition of the Unix computing philosophy, here is
yet another operator that does one simple task, namely the
creation of an AVI MJPEG file given a list of JPEG/JFIF files.

I had some difficulty in performing this extremely simple task
in Linux, mostly because it is so simple and all of the existing
code to do it lie at the bottom of complicated and more ambitious
projects--e.g. xawtv, avifile, etc.  I then had to waste
time reading M$ docs and xawtv source to find out how to do it.


II. Installation

The code is pretty basic, and so it should be pretty easy to
install:  "make all" compiles the program, "make install"
installs it.  If you want the files to reside in some directory
besides /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man, edit "Makefile".

 
II. Usage

There are three basic modes of operation:

1. jpegtoavi per_usec width height img1 [img2 ... imgN]
2. jpegtoavi -f fps width height img1 [img2 ... imgN]
3. jpegtoavi -fsz img1 [img2 .. imgN]

The first two print an AVI to STDOUT using the width and height
parameters and the images named in chronological order.  (No
checks are made on the validity of the JPEG/JFIFs or their
dimensions.)  The first mode specifies the frame rate in
terms of the period in microseconds for each frame, whereas
the second specifies frames per second.

The third mode was added to give size hints during the transfer
of AVIs without the use of a temporary file.  Instead of
generating the AVI it outputs the size in bytes that of the AVI
that could have been generated.
