[ ] Wlanmodule needs to check if an interface supports wireless
    extensions.
[x] When you set options in wlanmodule, hit OK, it exits all of
    networksetup, doesnt bring you back to the main screen.
[x] Wlanmodule isnt writing out wireless.opts
[ ] Need a means of bringing an interface up and down (calling
    out ifup/ifdown) from the gui.
    -Ben- Click information, then click up or down... :-D
