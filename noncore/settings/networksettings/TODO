When entering the wep keys, I think we should be able to see what we are typing, but not to show the keys when the field is not in focus.   Otherwise, it's real hard to know if you typed the right wep key, and you have to look in the actual wireless.opts file to really know if you did it right.

When Zaurus is in cradle, USB interface is connected and reported as UP by the Network Setting application, clicking on Information button does not popup a window. It used to work before, but now it's broken in the latest feed...

-Z hangs on PCMCIA-eject of Symbol 802.11b card (card seems to be in an odd
state after first boot following reflash; see Additional Info)

udhcpc needs to output the dhcp information so interfaces can read it

interfacesetupimp really doesn't need a interface* pointer

PPP module needs to scan pppd.tdb to see what is currently active

- add possiblity to input text or hex without knowing "s:"
- Handle "any" and any the same way in config

Add a route/DNS editor under the ViewAdvancedInfo button

You can look up the meaning of the packets you receive, or you can just go 
poll for changes you might be interested in each time you receive _any_ 
packet. Anything's better than periodic polling.

Note that you can't do this as non-root on some kernels. There's a patch 
which can go into the hh.org kernel if it's not already there.
