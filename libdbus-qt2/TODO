- Have someone with Qt4 experience check the code marked with FIXME-QT4

- Port the Qt4 bindings' unit tests to something available for Qt3

- Add static methods for D-BUS standard errors to QDBusError.
  At least for those a service implementation might need more often

- Check possibility of a QObject adapter implementation of QDBusObjectBase,
  i.e. a making an QObject's slots callable through D-BUS
