+----  how to make your own keymap file. ----+

first of all, later on you will be able to choose the keymap, but right now it
selects the keymap according to your language setting. for example, if your 
language is "ko", it will select $OPIE_DIR/share/multikey/ko.keymap for the
keymap. so if you want to make a german keymap, copy the en.keymap file to
de.keymap, and edit it. 

your best friend is xmbfed. open the unicode font that is in
$QT_DIR/lib/fonts/unifont.bdf and search for the characters you want to input. 
in the keymap file, the columns are...

+--- row number (there are 5 rows)
| +- qcode (used for special chars like enter, escape, etc...)
| |
v v
1 0         0x36    2
            ^       ^
            |       |
            |       +---- width of key (default key should be 2)
            +--- the unicode value (the one you see in xmbded)

so, lets say you want to edit the 5th key on the 2nd row. find the 5th line
that starts with 2, and replace the 3rd column with the code you found in 
xmbdfed. save the file and test it out by restarting opie, or running 

host$ $OPIEDIR/bin/qcop QPE/TaskBar "reloadInputMethods()" 

it worked, right?  if all you see is a square in it's place, that means your
default font doesn't have that char. go to appearance and change the font to
one that has that char.

and if you want, you can have an image as the label instead of the char itself.
just draw the xpm image in gimp or something, save it, open it in your text
editor, cut off all the surrounding stuff and leave only the stuff between the
" chars. place that after your key definition. not too hard, right?
