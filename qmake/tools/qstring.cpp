    \brief The QCharRef class is a helper class for QString.

    \ingroup text

    When you get an object of type QCharRef, if you can assign to it,
    the assignment will apply to the character in the string from
    which you got the reference. That is its whole purpose in life.
    The QCharRef becomes invalid once modifications are made to the
    string: if you want to keep the character, copy it into a QChar.

    Most of the QChar member functions also exist in QCharRef.
    However, they are not explicitly documented here.

/*!
    \class QChar qstring.h
    \reentrant
    \brief The QChar class provides a lightweight Unicode character.

    \ingroup text

    Unicode characters are (so far) 16-bit entities without any markup
    or structure. This class represents such an entity. It is
    lightweight, so it can be used everywhere. Most compilers treat it
    like a "short int".  (In a few years it may be necessary to make
    QChar 32-bit when more than 65536 Unicode code points have been
    defined and come into use.)

    QChar provides a full complement of testing/classification
    functions, converting to and from other formats, converting from
    composed to decomposed Unicode, and trying to compare and
    case-convert if you ask it to.

    The classification functions include functions like those in
    ctype.h, but operating on the full range of Unicode characters.
    They all return TRUE if the character is a certain type of
    character; otherwise they return FALSE. These classification
    functions are isNull() (returns TRUE if the character is U+0000),
    isPrint() (TRUE if the character is any sort of printable
    character, including whitespace), isPunct() (any sort of
    punctation), isMark() (Unicode Mark), isLetter (a letter),
    isNumber() (any sort of numeric character), isLetterOrNumber(),
    and isDigit() (decimal digits). All of these are wrappers around
    category() which return the Unicode-defined category of each
    character.

    QChar further provides direction(), which indicates the "natural"
    writing direction of this character. The joining() function
    indicates how the character joins with its neighbors (needed
    mostly for Arabic) and finally mirrored(), which indicates whether
    the character needs to be mirrored when it is printed in its
    "unnatural" writing direction.

    Composed Unicode characters (like &aring;) can be converted to
    decomposed Unicode ("a" followed by "ring above") by using
    decomposition().

    In Unicode, comparison is not necessarily possible and case
    conversion is very difficult at best. Unicode, covering the
    "entire" world, also includes most of the world's case and sorting
    problems. Qt tries, but not very hard: operator==() and friends
    will do comparison based purely on the numeric Unicode value (code
    point) of the characters, and upper() and lower() will do case
    changes when the character has a well-defined upper/lower-case
    equivalent. There is no provision for locale-dependent case
    folding rules or comparison; these functions are meant to be fast
    so they can be used unambiguously in data structures. (See
    QString::localeAwareCompare() though.)

    The conversion functions include unicode() (to a scalar), latin1()
    (to scalar, but converts all non-Latin1 characters to 0), row()
    (gives the Unicode row), cell() (gives the Unicode cell),
    digitValue() (gives the integer value of any of the numerous digit
    characters), and a host of constructors.

    More information can be found in the document \link unicode.html

    \class QString qstring.h
    \reentrant

    \brief The QString class provides an abstraction of Unicode text
    and the classic C '\0'-terminated char array.

    \ingroup tools
    \ingroup shared
    \ingroup text
    \mainclass

    QString uses \link shclass.html implicit sharing\endlink, which
    makes it very efficient and easy to use.

    In all of the QString methods that take \c {const char *}
    parameters, the \c {const char *} is interpreted as a classic
    C-style '\0'-terminated ASCII string. It is legal for the \c
    {const char *} parameter to be 0. If the \c {const char *} is not
    '\0'-terminated, the results are undefined. Functions that copy
    classic C strings into a QString will not copy the terminating
    '\0' character. The QChar array of the QString (as returned by
    unicode()) is generally not terminated by a '\0'. If you need to
    pass a QString to a function that requires a C '\0'-terminated
    string use latin1().

    \keyword QString::null
    A QString that has not been assigned to anything is \e null, i.e.
    both the length and data pointer is 0. A QString that references
    the empty string ("", a single '\0' char) is \e empty. Both null
    and empty QStrings are legal parameters to the methods. Assigning
    \c{(const char *) 0} to QString gives a null QString. For
    convenience, \c QString::null is a null QString. When sorting,
    empty strings come first, followed by non-empty strings, followed
    by null strings. We recommend using \c{if ( !str.isNull() )} to
    check for a non-null string rather than \c{if ( !str )}; see \l
    operator!() for an explanation.

    Note that if you find that you are mixing usage of \l QCString,
    QString, and \l QByteArray, this causes lots of unnecessary
    copying and might indicate that the true nature of the data you
    are dealing with is uncertain. If the data is '\0'-terminated 8-bit
    data, use \l QCString; if it is unterminated (i.e. contains '\0's)
    8-bit data, use \l QByteArray; if it is text, use QString.

    Lists of strings are handled by the QStringList class. You can
    split a string into a list of strings using QStringList::split(),
    and join a list of strings into a single string with an optional
    separator using QStringList::join(). You can obtain a list of
    strings from a string list that contain a particular substring or
    that match a particular \link qregexp.html regex\endlink using
    QStringList::grep().

    <b>Note for C programmers</b>

    Due to C++'s type system and the fact that QString is implicitly
    shared, QStrings may be treated like ints or other simple base
    types. For example:

    \code
    QString boolToString( bool b )
    {
	QString result;
	if ( b )
	    result = "True";
	else
	    result = "False";
	return result;
    }
    \endcode

    The variable, result, is an auto variable allocated on the stack.
    When return is called, because we're returning by value, The copy
    constructor is called and a copy of the string is returned. (No
    actual copying takes place thanks to the implicit sharing, see
    below.)

    Throughout Qt's source code you will encounter QString usages like
    this:
    \code
    QString func( const QString& input )
    {
	QString output = input;
	// process output
	return output;
    }
    \endcode

    The 'copying' of input to output is almost as fast as copying a
    pointer because behind the scenes copying is achieved by
    incrementing a reference count. QString (like all Qt's implicitly
    shared classes) operates on a copy-on-write basis, only copying if
    an instance is actually changed.

    If you wish to create a deep copy of a QString without losing any
    Unicode information then you should use QDeepCopy.

    \sa QChar QCString QByteArray QConstString
*/

/*! \enum Qt::ComparisonFlags
\internal
*/
/*!
    \enum Qt::StringComparisonMode

    This enum type is used to set the string comparison mode when
    searching for an item. It is used by QListBox, QListView and
    QIconView, for example. We'll refer to the string being searched
    as the 'target' string.

    \value CaseSensitive The strings must match case sensitively.
    \value ExactMatch The target and search strings must match exactly.
    \value BeginsWith The target string begins with the search string.
    \value EndsWith The target string ends with the search string.
    \value Contains The target string contains the search string.

    If you OR these flags together (excluding \c CaseSensitive), the
    search criteria be applied in the following order: \c ExactMatch,
    \c BeginsWith, \c EndsWith, \c Contains.

    Matching is case-insensitive unless \c CaseSensitive is set. \c
    CaseSensitive may be OR-ed with any combination of the other
    flags.

/*!
    Safely builds a formatted string from the format string \a cformat

    the escape sequences of printf() in the standard C library.

    The %s escape sequence expects a utf8() encoded string. The format
    string \e cformat is expected to be in latin1. If you need a
    Unicode format string, use arg() instead. For typesafe string
    building, with full Unicode support, you can use QTextOStream like
    this:

    \code
	QString str;
	QString s = ...;
	int x = ...;
	QTextOStream( &str ) << s << " : " << x;
    \endcode

    For \link QObject::tr() translations,\endlink especially if the
    strings contains more than one escape sequence, you should
    consider using the arg() function instead. This allows the order
    of the replacements to be controlled by the translator, and has
    Unicode support.

    This function returns a section of the string.

    This string is treated as a sequence of fields separated by the
    character, \a sep. The returned string consists of the fields from
    position \a start to position \a end inclusive. If \a end is not
    specified, all fields from position \a start to the end of the
    string are included. Fields are numbered 0, 1, 2, etc., counting
    from the left, and -1, -2, etc., counting from right to left.

    The \a flags argument can be used to affect some aspects of the
    function's behaviour, e.g. whether to be case sensitive, whether
    to skip empty fields and how to deal with leading and trailing
    separators; see \l{SectionFlags}.

    \code
    QString csv( "forename,middlename,surname,phone" );

    QString s = path.section( '/', 3, 4 );  // s == "bin/myapp"
    QString s = path.section( '/', 3, 3, SectionSkipEmpty ); // s == "myapp"
    \endcode

    If \a start or \a end is negative, we count fields from the right
    of the string, the right-most field being -1, the one from
    right-most field being -2, and so on.

  \class QConstString qstring.h
  \reentrant
  \ingroup text
  \brief The QConstString class provides string objects using constant Unicode data.

    In order to minimize copying, highly optimized applications can
    use QConstString to provide a QString-compatible object from
    existing Unicode data. It is then the programmer's responsibility
    to ensure that the Unicode data exists for the entire lifetime of
    the QConstString object.

    A QConstString is created with the QConstString constructor. The
    string held by the object can be obtained by calling string().
*/

/*!
    Constructs a QConstString that uses the first \a length Unicode
    characters in the array \a unicode. Any attempt to modify copies
    of the string will cause it to create a copy of the data, thus it
    remains forever unmodified.

    The data in \a unicode is not copied. The caller must be able to
    guarantee that \a unicode will not be deleted or modified.
