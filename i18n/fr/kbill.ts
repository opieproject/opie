        <source>&lt;b&gt;The Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet again, the fate of the world rests in your hands!  An evil computer hacker, known only by his handle &apos;Bill&apos;, has created the ultimate computer virus.  A virus so powerful that it has the power to transmute an ordinary computer into a toaster oven.  (oooh!) &apos;Bill&apos; has cloned himself into a billion-jillion micro-Bills.  Their sole purpose is to deliver the nefarious virus, which has been cleverly diguised as a popular operating system. As System Administrator and Exterminator, your job is to keep Bill from succeeding at his task.</source>

        <source>&lt;b&gt;The Rules&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;kBill has been painstakingly designed and researched in order to make it as easy to use for the whole family as it is for little Sally. Years - nay - days of beta testing and consulting with the cheapest of human interface designers have resulted in a game that is easy to use, yet nothing at all like a Macintosh.&lt;p&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Whack the Bills (click)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Restart the computer (click)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pick up stolen OSes &amp; return (drag) them to their respective computers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Drag the bucket to extinguish sparks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Scoring is based on total uptime, with bonuses for killing Bills.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As for the rest, you can probably work it out for yourself.  We did, so it can&apos;t be too hard</source>
