                           -=] INTRODUCTION [=-

With the posting of eBook #10001 in November of 2003, a major change in
eBook filenaming was instituted.  Prior to that, Project Gutenberg eBooks
were assigned unique base filenames, usually 5 characters.  Each of those
files also has a version number; and these files are arranged by the year
they were released.

Beginning with #10001, the eBook number is also being used as the base
filename.  For example, the plain text version of #10010 will have the
filename 10010.txt; the HTML version would have the filename 10010-h.htm.

Also, with new-style postings, each eBook is posted in a subdirectory based
on the same number as the eBook number; all of the available formats of each
eBook will be accessible in that subdirectory.


.:: HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG ::.

The easiest way to obtain our eBooks is at our search page at

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

which allows searching by title, author or eBook number; there is also
an Advanced Search page which allows for additional search criteria
(note that our newer postings may not yet be indexed for all additional
criteria).

And please note:  you can now obtain a listing by language at the above
link.

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world, and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on
the search results page.

To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest to you,
visit:

  http://gutenberg.net/list.shtml

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 are located in "release year" directories. Over
time, the "release year" advanced, so that by November 2003 the release year
was 2006.  Starting with eBook #10001, they are filed by their official eBook
number, with a unique subdirectory based on that eBook number.

Corrected EDITIONS of these eBooks replace the old file and are then given the
original filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed and
archived.

New VERSIONS are based on different sources, and are treated as new eBooks,
to which are assigned new filenames and etext numbers.

File formats other than plain text will have a format-designator appended to the
filename, as well as an appropriate file extension.  The following list
indicates the most common formats likely to be found at Project Gutenberg:

  Plain text       12345.txt          12345.zip
  8-bit text       12345-8.txt        12345-8.zip
    (Includes: ISO-8859-1, CP-1252, MacRoman)
  Big-5            12345-5.txt        12345-5.zip
  Unicode          12345-0.txt        12345-0.zip

  HTML             12345-h.htm        12345-h.zip
  TeX              12345-t.tex        12345-t.zip
  XML              12345-x.xml        12345-x.zip
  MP3              12345-m-###.mp3    12345-m.zip
  RTF              12345-r.rtf        12345-r.zip

  PDF              12345-pdf.pdf      12345-pdf.zip
  LIT              12345-lit.lit      12345-lit.zip
  MS Word Doc      12345-doc.doc      12345-doc.zip
  PDB              12345-pdb.pdb      12345-pdb.zip

To get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/1/
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/

. . .navigate down through the subdirectories until you get to the appropriate
level, and then select the file you wish to download, using your normal download
procedures.


--INSTANT ACCESS TO EBOOKS NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 10000

eBooks posted prior to November 2003, and with etext numbers UNDER #10001,
are filed in a different way than described above.  Please note that it
is still recommended to start at the main PG search facility:

  http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml

Filenames are to be found in the listing below.  The year of the release
date indicates the subdirectory in which the files will be found; for
example, if the release year was 2001, the subdirectory would be /etext01/.

Consider Alice in Wonderland:

Jan 1991 Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll [Carroll #1]   [alicexxx.xxx]   11

The line indicates the following:
1. The eBook was released in January, 1991
2. The eBook's name and author are "Alice in Wonderland" by "Lewis Carroll"
3. This is #1 in a series of books by the author
4. The base filename is "alice"
5. The eBook was #11 for Project Gutenberg

To find this book, look for files in the etext91 directory (for 1991)
starting with "alice".  To download this file directly:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext91/alice10.zip
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext91/alice10.zip

And to get to a directory listing you can use either:

  http://gutenberg.net/etext06
    - or -
  ftp://gutenberg.net/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext06

. . .then navigating to the subdirectory that correspondes to the release
year, and then select the file you wish to download, using your normal
download procedures.

A "?" at the begining of the filename indicates that the eBook is
available in both 7- & 8- bit versions; the 7 indicates a file formatted
in plain 7-bit ASCII; the 8 is for a version with an extended character
set, often Latin 1 (also known as ISO-8859-1), which includes a set of
accented characters and special symbols.  For non-English eBooks, one of
the 8-bit character sets is often used.  A "1" or "2" for the same eBook
filename usually -- not always -- indicates a multi-volume set, as in
7wml1xxx.xxx and 7wml2xxx.xxx.

Corrected EDITIONS of these eBooks get a new edition NUMBER, xxxxx11.txt,
   and prior to 1998, occasionally a new eBook number.  They are kept
   in the same directory as their predecessors.

VERSIONS based on separate sources get a new LETTER, xxxxx10a.txt, as
   well as a new eBook number; these are posted in the directory
   corresponding to their release year.

- Files ending in .txt are text files, and are viewable with nearly any file
  viewer, including a Web browser.  Files with the .txt extension can be either
  7-bit plain text, or one of the 8-bit character sets, including ISO-8859-1,
  CP-1252, and MacRoman.
- Files ending in .htm are HTML files, which contain markup codes for a Web
  browser.

See above for more about other file formats and file extensions.


             -=] A LITTLE MORE ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG FILES [=-

In all cases, we try to keep all the old files for research and archival
purposes.  When a very small number of corrections are made, a new edition might
not be created, but a "Most recently updated" line is added to the file.


--ABOUT 7-BIT TEXT, aka PLAIN VANILLA ASCII:

Whenever possible, Project Gutenberg distributes a plain text version of an
eBook. Other formats, such as HTML, XML, RTF, and others are also welcome, but
plain text is the "lowest common denominator." We stress the inclusion of plain
text because of its longevity: Project Gutenberg includes numerous text files
that are 20-30 years old. In that time, dozens of widely used file formats have
come and gone. Text is accessible on all computers, and is also insurance
against future obsolescence.

The only times when Project Gutenberg distributes an eBook without a plain text
version are when plain text is impossible or impractical -- for example, for our
movies and MP3 audio files, and for some of our mathematical works.

     (Please note that files ending in .tex are mainly technical writings
      in TeX or LaTeX format, and should not be confused with text files.)


--ABOUT ZIP FILES:

Files ending in .zip are compressed using the Zip method. This saves space, and
should result in faster downloads; often, they include images or support files.
Whenever practical, Project Gutenberg files are available as a zipped file.

--GENERAL

We try to annotate the individual listings if they don't conform to the above
methodologies.

For more information about file formats, Zip programs, file viewers,
and other topics, visit the official Project Gutenberg Web page
at http://www.gutenberg.net

--HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM OUR MIRROR SITES

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the world.
When you use the search function at http://gutenberg.net/find.shtml, you can
select a suitable mirror from which to download your selection.

--ABOUT SUBMITTING NEW EBOOKS

if you are considering adding a new eBook to the Project Gutenberg
collection, Please make sure that any books you want to work on are _not_
already in the collection.  To see what is already online, refer to the
listing below.  Also, please be sure to check David Price's "In Progress"
list at:

  http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html

to ensure no one is currently working on your selection.  It would also
be helpful if you obtain copyright clearance prior to submitting books.

 removes the necessity for US libraries to run filtering software
 as had been ordered by the CIPA legislation.  PG doesn't usually
 distribute legislation and rulings, but in this case it seemed
 worthwhile.  At 195 pages, the ruling is an extensive and informed
 look at Internet use and censorship.)

Re: indexing, by Michael S. Hart:

My apologies to real indexers, as the naming and numbering
structure was not a high priority in the days previous; it
was originally considered that we would do one eBook 1971,
another in 1972, and then on to Shakespeare and the Bible,
with each play or book counting as one title, and thus our
numbering system for a while included about 40 files of an
eBook collection of Shakespeare that never appeared due to
changes in the copyright laws that were not completed when
Project Gutenberg went into action in 1971, and left us up
in the air for quite some time.  Please be advised that it
is again being proposed to lengthen copyright terms and to
return items from the Public Domain to copyright status, a
constitutionally unlawful act [ex post facto laws!] except
that treaties can somehow legally defy the constitution.

A THOROUGH reading of NAFTA, might explain that.

Thus, during the years when ONE play or book of the Bible,
or similarly sized file seemed like a major accomplishment
[remember, the FIRST Project Gutenberg eBook was only 5000
characters or so, The Declaration of Independence, but the
file took up 1/2000th of the entire space of the mainframe
we started on, which was two 5M hard drives.  Thus we said
we were not going to put all Shakespeare or the Bible on a
server at one time, since each of those files was 5 Meg].

However, unlike those who would prefer you to think a huge
amount of data is in their collections, we would prefer to
post Shakespeare and the Bible as a single file each, even
though they are each a thousand times larger than that 1st
file back in 1971.  With due respect to the United States,
and the spirit with which we started Project Gutenberg, we
will keep the first three file names as they appeared, WHEN
being the filename we used for the Declaration, BILL for a
copy of the Bill of Rights and CONST for the Constitution.

Re: the works of Sir Walter Scott, esp. the title "Waverly"; also a quick
explanation of the entries in this listing.

The constraints of this GUTINDEX.ALL listing (lines of 80-character width)
sometimes require a sort-of "shorthand"; many of the listings have titles that
may seem somewhat cryptic, which is why there are supplemental title, author and
information lines for many of the entries.

The works of Sir Walter Scott are an example of how this complication in listing
the works can be further complicated.  "Waverly" was first published by
"Anonymous", and it was more than a couple of years before Sir Walter Scott was
acknowledged as the author; in the interim, he authored several more works,
which were attribted to the "Author of Waverly".  Some of these were novels,
some were collections of stories.  All have become generally known as the
Waverly Novels, which makes them easy to confuse with the novel "Waverly", the
first of those Waverly Novels.

(Ed. note:  may add list of Scott's works here)

There has been some confusion over the authorship of various publications of
the Boy Scouts.  The following is extracted from an email by William
Fishburne which may shed some light; this info may be updated as further
clarification becomes available.

Subject: [posted] Re: Posted (#6339, Blaine)


--<cut>--
Apparently there was a huge effort to cash in on the "boy scout"
concept and there was limited protection on the name.  The number of
authors with "boy scout" titles is staggering because real authors
used multiple pseudonyms to protect their identity (and thus save
themselves from law suits).

This series was written by Robert Maitland and Georgia Roberts Durston
(aka George Durston, which was a pseudonym shared by several authors--
particularly used by J.W. Duffield when writing "Boy Scouts with King
George" which was subsequently reprinted as "Boy Scout Aviators"--see
http://www.keeline.com/SC-A.pdf) according to
http://unofficial.umkc.edu/crossonm/boyscoutsdurstonmaitland.htm which
has been a fairly reliable source for this type of information for me
in the past.  This site also mentions that several of the books in the
series were reprinted under the name "Edward Griggs."

It is worth noting that "John Blaine" is a fairly prolific author of
children's books and may well have contributed to this series.

The Library of Congress website says that "John Blaine" was a joint
pseudonym of Harold L. Goodwin and Peter J. Harkins.

The 1918 Saalfield edition is attributed to Georgia Roberts Durston
according the Library of Congress in keeping with your findings.
Apparently, there was also a 1921 printing from Saalfield attributed
to her.

The 1918 copyright is given in the cleared files as the year of the
edition attributed to Blaine.

There is another cleared version of this book with G. Harvey Ralphson
as the author (1912).  This 1912 edition was published by M.A. Donohoe
& Co (see http://unofficial.umkc.edu/crossonm/ralphsonboyscouts.htm).
It is apparently possible (I read about this on a couple of sites, but
didn't realize that I should have written the name down, sorry) that
this book was ghost written by Durston as several authors apparently
did the ghost writing for Ralphson.

Apparently she also used the pseudonym Colonel George Durston as well,
see http://www.seriesbooks.com/bseries.htm

It is probably safe to put Durston as the author with Blaine as a
pseudonym and it might be worth noting that she was probably a
ghostwriter for G. Harvey Ralphson (in the PG collection #6108).

(On 2/15/03, Michael Hart wrote the following:)

A word of explanation about the series numbers.

The original idea behind the series numbers was
to encourage looking at more books, kind of a
predecessor to those little notes you get on
some sites that promote music, books, etc:

"If you like this, perhaps you would like. . . ."

I just want to have SOMETHING near the top of the
book that lets people know there are more. . .just
as we encourage our readers to send suggestions for
more books for US to do. . . .

Lots of our readers start by getting one of our PG
eBooks from some other source than directly from
one of our sites or mirrors, and thus they don't
have any context of what else is available.

I'd like to at least keep the series numbers until
we can come up with something else on this order.

Also, the number doesn't have to be something exact,
it could simply say something on the order of:

"At the time of publication there were over a dozen
more works listed in our catalog by this author."

I don't want these books to appear as "standalones,"
but rather to encourage further reading. . . .
