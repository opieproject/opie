The wordlists here are:

words     = /usr/dict/words on a Linux machine
words.de  = igerman98-20000206 (German ispell), excluding zusammen.txt
words.no  = ispell-norsk-1.1a (Norwegian ispell)

The "dawg" form of each is automatically generated from the "words" form.
Note that this takes a LOT of memory. Don't try it on an iPAQ, etc.
